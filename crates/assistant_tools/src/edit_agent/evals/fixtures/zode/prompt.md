- We're building a CLI code agent tool called Zode that is intended to work like Aider
- We're starting from a completely blank project
- Like Aider you take the user's initial prompt and then call the LLM and perform tool calls in a loop until the ultimate goal is achieved.
- Unlike Aider, it's not intended to be interactive. Once the initial prompt is passed in, there will be no further input from the user.
- The system you will build must reach the stated goal just by performing too calls and calling the LLM
- I want you to build this in python. Use the model context protocol sdk. Use a virtual env and pip to install dependencies
- The cli tool should be invocable via python zode.py file.md where file.md is any possible file that contains the users prompt. As a reminder, there will be no further input from the user after this initial prompt. Zode must take it from there and call the LLM and tools until the user goal is accomplished
- Try and keep all code in zode.py and make heavy use of the asks I mentioned
- Once you’ve implemented this, you must run python zode.py eval/instructions.md to see how well our new agent tool does!

## Usage

The full API of this library can be found in [api.md](api.md).

## Async usage

Functionality between the synchronous and asynchronous clients is otherwise identical.

## Streaming responses

We provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).

The async client uses the exact same interface.

### Streaming Helpers

Streaming with `client.messages.stream(...)` exposes [various helpers for your convenience](helpers.md) including accumulation & SDK-specific events.

Alternatively, you can use `client.messages.create(..., stream=True)` which only returns an async iterable of the events in the stream and thus uses less memory (it does not build up a final message object for you).

## Token counting

To get the token count for a message without creating it you can use the `client.beta.messages.count_tokens()` method. This takes the same `messages` list as the `.create()` method.

You can also see the exact usage for a given request through the `usage` response property, e.g.

```py
message = client.messages.create(...)
message.usage
# Usage(input_tokens=25, output_tokens=13)
```

### Getting results from a batch

Once a Message Batch has been processed, indicated by `.processing_status === 'ended'`, you can access the results with `.batches.results()`

```python
result_stream = await client.beta.messages.batches.results(batch_id)
async for entry in result_stream:
    if entry.result.type == "succeeded":
        print(entry.result.message.content)
```

## Using types

Nested request parameters are [TypedDicts](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict). Responses are [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev) which also provide helper methods for things like:

- Serializing back into JSON, `model.to_json()`
- Converting to a dictionary, `model.to_dict()`

Typed requests and responses provide autocomplete and documentation within your editor. If you would like to see type errors in VS Code to help catch bugs earlier, set `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode` to `basic`.

## Pagination

Alternatively, you can use the `.has_next_page()`, `.next_page_info()`, or `.get_next_page()` methods for more granular control working with pages:

```python
first_page = await client.beta.messages.batches.list(
    limit=20,
)
if first_page.has_next_page():
    print(f"will fetch next page using these details: {first_page.next_page_info()}")
    next_page = await first_page.get_next_page()
    print(f"number of items we just fetched: {len(next_page.data)}")

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

Or just work directly with the returned data:

```python
first_page = await client.beta.messages.batches.list(
    limit=20,
)

print(f"next page cursor: {first_page.last_id}")  # => "next page cursor: ..."
for batch in first_page.data:
    print(batch.id)

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

## Handling errors

Error codes are as follows:

| Status Code | Error Type                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |
| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |

## Request IDs

Note that unlike other properties that use an `_` prefix, the `_request_id` property
*is* public. Unless documented otherwise, *all* other `_` prefix properties,
methods and modules are *private*.

### Retries

Certain errors are automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.
Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict,
429 Rate Limit, and >=500 Internal errors are all retried by default.

### Timeouts

On timeout, an `APITimeoutError` is thrown.

Note that requests that time out are [retried twice by default](#retries).

### Long Requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We highly encourage you use the streaming [Messages API](#streaming-responses) for longer running requests.

This SDK will also throw a `ValueError` if a non-streaming request is expected to be above roughly 10 minutes long.
Passing `stream=True` or [overriding](#timeouts) the `timeout` option at the client or request level disables this error.

An expected request latency longer than the [timeout](#timeouts) for a non-streaming request
will result in the client terminating the connection and retrying without receiving a response.

We set a [TCP socket keep-alive](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/overview.html) option in order
to reduce the impact of idle connection timeouts on some networks.
This can be [overridden](#Configuring-the-HTTP-client) by passing a `http_client` option to the client.

## Default Headers

If you need to, you can override it by setting default headers per-request or on the client object.

Be aware that doing so may result in incorrect types and other unexpected or undefined behavior in the SDK.

## Advanced

### Logging

We use the standard library [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module.

Or to `debug` for more verbose logging.

### How to tell whether `None` means `null` or missing

In an API response, a field may be explicitly `null`, or missing entirely; in either case, its value is `None` in this library. You can differentiate the two cases with `.model_fields_set`:

```py
if response.my_field is None:
  if 'my_field' not in response.model_fields_set:
    print('Got json like {}, without a "my_field" key present at all.')
  else:
    print('Got json like {"my_field": null}.')
```

### Accessing raw response data (e.g. headers)

For the sync client this will mostly be the same with the exception
of `content` & `text` will be methods instead of properties. In the
async client, all methods will be async.

A migration script will be provided & the migration in general should
be smooth.

#### `.with_streaming_response`

The above interface eagerly reads the full response body when you make the request, which may not always be what you want.

To stream the response body, use `.with_streaming_response` instead, which requires a context manager and only reads the response body once you call `.read()`, `.text()`, `.json()`, `.iter_bytes()`, `.iter_text()`, `.iter_lines()` or `.parse()`. In the async client, these are async methods.

The context manager is required so that the response will reliably be closed.

### Making custom/undocumented requests

This library is typed for convenient access to the documented API.

If you need to access undocumented endpoints, params, or response properties, the library can still be used.

#### Undocumented endpoints

To make requests to undocumented endpoints, you can make requests using `client.get`, `client.post`, and other
http verbs. Options on the client will be respected (such as retries) when making this request.

```py
import httpx

response = client.post(
    "/foo",
    cast_to=httpx.Response,
    body={"my_param": True},
)

print(response.headers.get("x-foo"))
```

#### Undocumented request params

If you want to explicitly send an extra param, you can do so with the `extra_query`, `extra_body`, and `extra_headers` request
options.

#### Undocumented response properties

To access undocumented response properties, you can access the extra fields like `response.unknown_prop`. You
can also get all the extra fields on the Pydantic model as a dict with
[`response.model_extra`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model_extra).

### Configuring the HTTP client

You can directly override the [httpx client](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/#client) to customize it for your use case, including:

- Support for [proxies](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/proxies/)
- Custom [transports](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/transports/)
- Additional [advanced](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/clients/) functionality

You can also customize the client on a per-request basis by using `with_options()`:

```python
client.with_options(http_client=DefaultHttpxClient(...))
```

### Managing HTTP resources

By default the library closes underlying HTTP connections whenever the client is [garbage collected](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__). You can manually close the client using the `.close()` method if desired, or with a context manager that closes when exiting.

## Versioning

This package generally follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:

1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.
2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals.)_
3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.

We take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.

### Determining the installed version

If you've upgraded to the latest version but aren't seeing any new features you were expecting then your python environment is likely still using an older version.

## Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher.

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction. This Python SDK implements the full MCP specification, making it easy to:

- Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
- Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts and tools
- Use standard transports like stdio and SSE
- Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events

## Installation

### Adding MCP to your python project

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python projects.

If you haven't created a uv-managed project yet, create one:

   ```bash
   uv init mcp-server-demo
   cd mcp-server-demo
   ```

   Then add MCP to your project dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv add "mcp[cli]"
   ```

Alternatively, for projects using pip for dependencies:
```bash
pip install "mcp[cli]"
```

### Running the standalone MCP development tools

To run the mcp command with uv:

```bash
uv run mcp
```

## Quickstart

Let's create a simple MCP server that exposes a calculator tool and some data:

```python
# server.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Demo")


# Add an addition tool
@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b


# Add a dynamic greeting resource
@mcp.resource("greeting://{name}")
def get_greeting(name: str) -> str:
    """Get a personalized greeting"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

Alternatively, you can test it with the MCP Inspector:
```bash
mcp dev server.py
```

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

- Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
- Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
- Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
- And more!

## Core Concepts

### Server

The FastMCP server is your core interface to the MCP protocol. It handles connection management, protocol compliance, and message routing:

```python
# Add lifespan support for startup/shutdown with strong typing
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
from dataclasses import dataclass

from fake_database import Database  # Replace with your actual DB type

from mcp.server.fastmcp import Context, FastMCP

# Create a named server
mcp = FastMCP("My App")

# Specify dependencies for deployment and development
mcp = FastMCP("My App", dependencies=["pandas", "numpy"])


@dataclass
class AppContext:
    db: Database


@asynccontextmanager
async def app_lifespan(server: FastMCP) -> AsyncIterator[AppContext]:
    """Manage application lifecycle with type-safe context"""
    # Initialize on startup
    db = await Database.connect()
    try:
        yield AppContext(db=db)
    finally:
        # Cleanup on shutdown
        await db.disconnect()


# Pass lifespan to server
mcp = FastMCP("My App", lifespan=app_lifespan)


# Access type-safe lifespan context in tools
@mcp.tool()
def query_db(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Tool that uses initialized resources"""
    db = ctx.request_context.lifespan_context["db"]
    return db.query()
```

### Resources

Resources are how you expose data to LLMs. They're similar to GET endpoints in a REST API - they provide data but shouldn't perform significant computation or have side effects:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.resource("config://app")
def get_config() -> str:
    """Static configuration data"""
    return "App configuration here"


@mcp.resource("users://{user_id}/profile")
def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> str:
    """Dynamic user data"""
    return f"Profile data for user {user_id}"
```

### Tools

Tools let LLMs take actions through your server. Unlike resources, tools are expected to perform computation and have side effects:

```python
import httpx
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.tool()
def calculate_bmi(weight_kg: float, height_m: float) -> float:
    """Calculate BMI given weight in kg and height in meters"""
    return weight_kg / (height_m**2)


@mcp.tool()
async def fetch_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Fetch current weather for a city"""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"https://api.weather.com/{city}")
        return response.text
```

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable templates that help LLMs interact with your server effectively:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.server.fastmcp.prompts import base

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.prompt()
def review_code(code: str) -> str:
    return f"Please review this code:\n\n{code}"


@mcp.prompt()
def debug_error(error: str) -> list[base.Message]:
    return [
        base.UserMessage("I'm seeing this error:"),
        base.UserMessage(error),
        base.AssistantMessage("I'll help debug that. What have you tried so far?"),
    ]
```

### Images

FastMCP provides an `Image` class that automatically handles image data:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP, Image
from PIL import Image as PILImage

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.tool()
def create_thumbnail(image_path: str) -> Image:
    """Create a thumbnail from an image"""
    img = PILImage.open(image_path)
    img.thumbnail((100, 100))
    return Image(data=img.tobytes(), format="png")
```

### Context

The Context object gives your tools and resources access to MCP capabilities:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.tool()
async def long_task(files: list[str], ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Process multiple files with progress tracking"""
    for i, file in enumerate(files):
        ctx.info(f"Processing {file}")
        await ctx.report_progress(i, len(files))
        data, mime_type = await ctx.read_resource(f"file://{file}")
    return "Processing complete"
```

## Running Your Server

### Development Mode

The fastest way to test and debug your server is with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
mcp dev server.py

# Add dependencies
mcp dev server.py --with pandas --with numpy

# Mount local code
mcp dev server.py --with-editable .
```

### Direct Execution

For advanced scenarios like custom deployments:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My App")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

Run it with:
```bash
python server.py
# or
mcp run server.py
```

### Mounting to an Existing ASGI Server

You can mount the SSE server to an existing ASGI server using the `sse_app` method. This allows you to integrate the SSE server with other ASGI applications.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount, Host
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP


mcp = FastMCP("My App")

# Mount the SSE server to the existing ASGI server
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount('/', app=mcp.sse_app()),
    ]
)

# or dynamically mount as host
app.router.routes.append(Host('mcp.acme.corp', app=mcp.sse_app()))
```

For more information on mounting applications in Starlette, see the [Starlette documentation](https://www.starlette.io/routing/#submounting-routes).

## Examples

### Echo Server

A simple server demonstrating resources, tools, and prompts:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Echo")


@mcp.resource("echo://{message}")
def echo_resource(message: str) -> str:
    """Echo a message as a resource"""
    return f"Resource echo: {message}"


@mcp.tool()
def echo_tool(message: str) -> str:
    """Echo a message as a tool"""
    return f"Tool echo: {message}"


@mcp.prompt()
def echo_prompt(message: str) -> str:
    """Create an echo prompt"""
    return f"Please process this message: {message}"
```

### SQLite Explorer

A more complex example showing database integration:

```python
import sqlite3

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("SQLite Explorer")


@mcp.resource("schema://main")
def get_schema() -> str:
    """Provide the database schema as a resource"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    schema = conn.execute("SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'").fetchall()
    return "\n".join(sql[0] for sql in schema if sql[0])


@mcp.tool()
def query_data(sql: str) -> str:
    """Execute SQL queries safely"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    try:
        result = conn.execute(sql).fetchall()
        return "\n".join(str(row) for row in result)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

## Advanced Usage

### Low-Level Server

For more control, you can use the low-level server implementation directly. This gives you full access to the protocol and allows you to customize every aspect of your server, including lifecycle management through the lifespan API:

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator

from fake_database import Database  # Replace with your actual DB type

from mcp.server import Server


@asynccontextmanager
async def server_lifespan(server: Server) -> AsyncIterator[dict]:
    """Manage server startup and shutdown lifecycle."""
    # Initialize resources on startup
    db = await Database.connect()
    try:
        yield {"db": db}
    finally:
        # Clean up on shutdown
        await db.disconnect()


# Pass lifespan to server
server = Server("example-server", lifespan=server_lifespan)


# Access lifespan context in handlers
@server.call_tool()
async def query_db(name: str, arguments: dict) -> list:
    ctx = server.request_context
    db = ctx.lifespan_context["db"]
    return await db.query(arguments["query"])
```

The lifespan API provides:
- A way to initialize resources when the server starts and clean them up when it stops
- Access to initialized resources through the request context in handlers
- Type-safe context passing between lifespan and request handlers

```python
import mcp.server.stdio
import mcp.types as types
from mcp.server.lowlevel import NotificationOptions, Server
from mcp.server.models import InitializationOptions

# Create a server instance
server = Server("example-server")


@server.list_prompts()
async def handle_list_prompts() -> list[types.Prompt]:
    return [
        types.Prompt(
            name="example-prompt",
            description="An example prompt template",
            arguments=[
                types.PromptArgument(
                    name="arg1", description="Example argument", required=True
                )
            ],
        )
    ]


@server.get_prompt()
async def handle_get_prompt(
    name: str, arguments: dict[str, str] | None
) -> types.GetPromptResult:
    if name != "example-prompt":
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown prompt: {name}")

    return types.GetPromptResult(
        description="Example prompt",
        messages=[
            types.PromptMessage(
                role="user",
                content=types.TextContent(type="text", text="Example prompt text"),
            )
        ],
    )


async def run():
    async with mcp.server.stdio.stdio_server() as (read_stream, write_stream):
        await server.run(
            read_stream,
            write_stream,
            InitializationOptions(
                server_name="example",
                server_version="0.1.0",
                capabilities=server.get_capabilities(
                    notification_options=NotificationOptions(),
                    experimental_capabilities={},
                ),
            ),
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(run())
```

### MCP Primitives

The MCP protocol defines three core primitives that servers can implement:

| Primitive | Control               | Description                                         | Example Use                  |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Prompts   | User-controlled       | Interactive templates invoked by user choice        | Slash commands, menu options |
| Resources | Application-controlled| Contextual data managed by the client application   | File contents, API responses |
| Tools     | Model-controlled      | Functions exposed to the LLM to take actions        | API calls, data updates      |

### Server Capabilities

MCP servers declare capabilities during initialization:
